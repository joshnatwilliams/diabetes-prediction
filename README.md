# 👨🏿‍⚕️ Diabetes Prediction App

This is an app designed to apply knowledge learned from my from my first semester of grad school. This is purely a fun project and is not meant to serve as a diagnostic tool for diabetes. I am not a medical professional so please do not take the results seriously. [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prosperchuks/health-dataset?select=diabetes_data.csv) is a link to the dataset.
